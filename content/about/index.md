I'm **Victor Alves**, a Brazilian passionate about applying rigorous statistical and econometric techniques to real-world problems.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Insper, one of Brazil's top institutions, where I graduated **magna cum laude** with a full scholarship. I am currently a PhD candidate in Economics at Insper, with research interests centered on applied microeconomics.

Beyond research, I am deeply committed to academic communication, effective teaching, and the democratization of knowledge — particularly through creating clear, high-quality educational resources that make sophisticated concepts accessible to wider audiences.
